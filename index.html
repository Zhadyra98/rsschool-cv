    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Currently, I work as a software test automation engineer at Epam Systems. I have almost 1 year of experience in test automation. However, I want to change my specialization and do my best at front-end development. I graduated from university in 2020 with a specialty in computer systems and software. When I do my tasks at work, always jobs related to UI interest me because it has visual representation and result. So, by ending this course I want to become a frontend developer and continue work in a new sphere.
